Americans and Germans worked diligently to advance submarine technology in the 19th century. The Bavarian artilleryman Wilhelm Bauer developed the first German submarine in 1850 with a view to the German-Danish War. This boat was also powered by muscle power.

However, during an inspection trip in Kiel Harbor, the boat filled with water and sank. A second German submarine designer was Gustav Winkler. However, his plans for a boat that sailed just above the water's surface were never realized. The breakthrough in submarine technology came with diesel engines, which had already been in use since the end of the 19th century.

German submarine U-96 was a Type VIIC U-boat of the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 16 September 1939, by Germaniawerft, of Kiel as yard number 601. She was commissioned on 14 September 1940, with Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock in command. Lehmann-Willenbrock was relieved in March 1942 by Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Jürgen Hellriegel, who was relieved in turn in March 1943 by Oblt.z.S. Wilhelm Peters. In February 1944, Oblt.z.S. Horst Willner took command, turning the boat over to Oblt.z.S. Robert Rix in June of that year. Rix commanded the boat until 15 February 1945.
