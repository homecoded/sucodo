... is a web application written mainly in JavaScript that checks for
plagiarisms in texts. The application runs locally and does not send
any data to any server except to search engines. The search engines will
only get chunks of the original data in a random order to make reconstructing
the text on the side of the search engine provider a bit harder.
The checked texts are not cached in any way.
